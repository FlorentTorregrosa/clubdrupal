* Migrate
Simply use the following commands in a clean environment: the folder in which
you launch these commands must not contains any csv or txt files from a previous
migration otherwise fix-db.rb won't work.
- python3 post_redmine.py
- ruby fix-db.rb

* Clean
Use in a python3 interpreter

#BEGIN_SRC python
import post_redmine
redmine = post_redmine.Redmine()
redmine.sweep()
#END_SRC

* Export as html
The export-issues-html.sh script allows you to export issues for a projet as
html files. It requires access to the database of redmine and only work for
mysql.

export-issues-html.sh PROJECT_ID
